# NOTE: although this is a rmd, markdown won't work. You should write it in TeX.
# (if I make a Rnw then it won't use pandoc so the YAML header is ignored)
# Hmm. I need knitr output to be in TeX. But if I save as Rnw it goes
# knitr {rtex -> tex} then pdflatex {tex -> pdf} without going through pandoc
#  [which is handy for the template]
#
# I guess what I want is
# knitr {rtex -> tex} then pandoc {tex -> tex; purely to insert the template} then pdflatex.

    \begin{exampleblock}{Summary}%
    Here is a barebones document for an A0 poster.
    It was based off http://www.nathanieljohnston.com/2009/08/latex-poster-template/ but has been modified to work as an R Markdown file to be compiled with knitr (rmd to md) and then pandoc (md to tex) and then latex (tex to pdf).
    
    This comes with its downsides (notably: that you can't use markdown within the blocks!!), but meh.
    \end{exampleblock}%

\begin{columns}[t] % align top
  \begin{column}{\colwid}
    \begin{block}{The Setup}
      Required files:
      
      \begin{itemize}
        \item `poste.rmd`, this example R Markdown file.
        \item `poster-pandoc-template.tex`, the pandoc template for the poster.
        \item `beamerthemeconfposter.sty`, the beamer style file (I \emph{think} you may be able to substitute your own, but I used the one from \url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/landscape-beamer-poster-template/vjpmsxxdvtqk}
      \end{itemize}
     
      Also: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item LaTeX packages `latexbeamer`, `pgf` (Tikz), `beamerposter`
        \item R package `knitr`
        \item pandoc
      \end{itemize}
      
      I've only tested this compiling from Rstudio.
      You can set authors and affiliations in the YAML metadata, along with limited beamer styling (block rounded corners and so on).
          
    \end{block}

    \begin{alertblock}{An Alert Block}
      The alert block environment looks like this. It also has justified text, but it has a border and a light background to make it stand out. You can create one like so:
      \begin{semiverbatim}
        {\color{red}\\begin}\{{\color{blue}alertblock}\}\{Title\}\newline
        \hskip1ex.......\newline
        {\color{red}\\end}\{{\color{blue}alertblock}\}
      \end{semiverbatim}
    \end{alertblock}
  \end{column}
  % column spanning two columns.
  \begin{column}{2\colwid}
    \begin{block}{Altering Column Spans}
      You can make columns that span multiple other columns relatively easily. Lengths are defined in the template that make columns look normal-ish if you want to use a three-column layout like this poster. If you want to use a different number of columns, you can specify the base column width in the YAML preamble.

      In particular, in the YAML:
      \begin{verbatim}
        columnwidth: '0.3\paperwidth'
      \end{verbatim}
      
      You get `\colwid` for free, and using the `calc` package you can get multiples of it.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{columns}[t,totalwidth=2.1\colwid]	% split up that two-column-wide column
      \begin{column}{\colwid}
        \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg=red,bg=white}%frame color
        \setbeamercolor{block body}{fg=black,bg=white}%body color
        \begin{block}{Block Colours}
          For the standard blocks there are two colours; one for the title and one for the block body:\\
          \begin{semiverbatim}
            {\color{red}\\setbeamercolor}\{block title\}\{fg=red,bg=white\}
            {\color{red}\\setbeamercolor}\{block  body\}\{fg=black,bg=white\}
          \end{semiverbatim}
          The \emph{fg} colour sets the text colour and \emph{bg} sets the background colour.
          For the normal blocks it makes no sense to use a background colour other than white. You \emph{can} change it, but it will look weird!
        \end{block} % block colours
        
		    \begin{block}{Todo}
		    \begin{itemize}
  		    \item block* a plain block (title no shading?)
  		    \item the only crucial thing in the sty is the headline definition, right? Can that be moved to the poster-pandoc.sty?
  		    \item knitr...
  		    \item the font looks funny.
  		    \item theming: user puts in a theme e.g. warsaw first for colours if they like
  		    \item more control over font size
  		    \item spacing between institutions seems too large
  		    \item logos
  		    \item bibliography without explicit `\bibitem`, ie integrate biblatex?
  		    \item more spacing between blocks//standard spacing
  		    \item easy styling and so on.
  		    \item [WONT] explicit control over separator width?
		    \end{itemize}
