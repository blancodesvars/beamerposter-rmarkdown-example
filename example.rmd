    \Begin{exampleblock}{Summary}
Here is a barebones document for an A0 poster.
It was based off [this poster provided by Nathaniel Johnston](http://www.nathanieljohnston.com/2009/08/latex-poster-template/) but has been heavily modified to work as an R Markdown file to be compiled with knitr (rmd to md) and then pandoc (md to tex) and then latex (tex to pdf).
    
In order to use markdown within blocks, you must use `\Begin{}` and `\End{}` for these blocks and their parents. Contents of these are parsed. Optional arguments to the begin/end are *not* properly handled, to do this you need to `\nopandoc{\begin{figure}[t]}` for example. Yes, it's stupid.

An undesirable side-effect of this is that the odd `%` comment symbols you litter throughout your TeX will be treated as literal by pandoc (!). Use HTML-style comments `<!-- comment -->` instead.

And if you indent the LaTeX, content of your blocks etc for readability, pandoc will probably think they're code blocks :/ This kind of sucks.

So not ideal, but better than nothing (you can always use `\begin{}` and `\end{}` if you want nothing within to be parsed).

\End{center}

\nopandoc{\begin{columns}[t]} <!-- align top. If I use Begin, pandoc takes the [t] ... -->
  \Begin{column}{\colwid}
    \Begin{block}{The Setup}
Required files:

* `poster.md`, this example R Markdown file.
* `poster-pandoc-template.tex`, the pandoc template for the poster.
* `beamerthemeconfposter.sty`, the beamer style file (I **think** you may be able to substitute your own, but I used the one from [here (
Computational Physics and Biophysics Group, Jacobs University, with modification by Nathaniel Johnston and Vel Gayevskiy)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/landscape-beamer-poster-template/vjpmsxxdvtqk)
     
Also: 

* LaTeX packages `latexbeamer`, `pgf` (Tikz), `beamerposter`
* R package `knitr`
* pandoc

I've only tested this compiling from Rstudio.
  You can set authors and affiliations in the YAML metadata, along with limited beamer styling (block rounded corners and so on).
    \End{block}

    \begin{alertblock}{An Alert Block}
The alert block environment looks like this. It also has justified text, but it has a border and a light background to make it stand out. You can create one like so:
      \begin{semiverbatim}
        {\color{red}\\Begin}\{{\color{blue}alertblock}\}\{Title\}\newline
        \hskip1ex.......\newline
        {\color{red}\\End}\{{\color{blue}alertblock}\}
      \end{semiverbatim}
    \end{alertblock}
  \End{column}
  <!-- column spanning two columns. -->
  \Begin{column}{2\colwid}
    \Begin{block}{Altering Column Spans}
You can make columns that span multiple other columns relatively easily. Lengths are defined in the template that make columns look normal-ish if you want to use a three-column layout like this poster. If you want to use a different number of columns, you can specify the base column width in the YAML preamble.

In particular, in the YAML:

~~~
columnwidth: '0.3\paperwidth'
~~~
      
You get `\colwid` for free, and using the `calc` package you can get multiples of it.
  \End{block}
   <!-- split up the 2-col wide column --> 
   \nopandoc{\begin{columns}[t,totalwidth=2.1\colwid]}
      \Begin{column}{\colwid}
        \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg=red,bg=white}%frame color
        \setbeamercolor{block body}{fg=black,bg=white}%body color
        \Begin{block}{Block Colours}
For the standard blocks there are two colours; one for the title and one for the block body:

\begin{semiverbatim}
  {\color{red}\\setbeamercolor}\{block title\}\{fg=red,bg=white\}
  {\color{red}\\setbeamercolor}\{block  body\}\{fg=black,bg=white\}
\end{semiverbatim}

The `fg` colour sets the text colour and `bg` sets the background colour.
For the normal blocks it makes no sense to use a background colour other than white. You *can* change it, but it will look weird!
        \End{block}<!-- Block colours -->
		    \Begin{block}{Todo}

* the only crucial thing in the sty is the headline definition, right? Can that be moved to the poster-pandoc.sty?
* knitr...
* the font looks funny.
* theming: user puts in a theme e.g. warsaw first for colours if they like
* more control over font size
* spacing between institutions seems too large
* logos
* bibliography without explicit `\bibitem`, ie integrate biblatex?
* more spacing between blocks//standard spacing
* easy styling and so on.
* [WONT] explicit control over separator width?

<!---->\End{block}<!-- that stupidness is because pandoc will treat this as a
                       code block o'wise and I want it indented for eadability. -->
        \begin{block}{References}
          Some references and a graphic to show you how it's done:

		      \small{\Begin{thebibliography}{99}%@TODO incorporate with a bibtex
		        \bibitem{KLPL06} D.~W. Kribs, R. Laflamme, D. Poulin, M. Lesosky, Quantum Inf. \& Comp. \textbf{6} (2006), 383-399.
		        \bibitem{zanardi97} P. Zanardi, M. Rasetti, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{79},  3306 (1997).
		      \End{thebibliography}}
		    \end{block} <!-- references -->
   \End{column}
   \Begin{column}{\colwid}
    \Begin{block}{Demo}
Some maths:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i}\text{ does not converge.}
\]

A figure:
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\colwid]{example-image}
  \caption{A caption.}
\end{figure}
    \End{block} <!-- demo -->
